Course Code - 19CCE495 - Project Phase -1 Enhanced Detection of the Monkeypox Virus Using Pretrained Deep Learning Models, Squeeze Excitation Layers, and XAI CH.EN.U4CCE21031 – Shashank Mahato Mentor: Dr. Muthulakshmi M About the Project: The objective of this research is to create a deep learning system that can accurately categorize viral skin disorders, with a specific focus on Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, and normal skin ailments. By employing data augmentation, the data is balanced in order to improve the performance of the model. Assessing several convolutional neural networks (CNN) architectures by using both Squeeze and Excitation layers in order to attain the utmost accuracy. The utilization of Explainable AI approaches, such as CAD and LIME, will be implemented to guarantee the transparency and interpretability of the model. The resultant system would provide a resilient, precise, and comprehensible tool for swift diagnosis of skin diseases, assisting healthcare practitioners in making well-informed judgments. System Design: Data Collection and Preprocessing: Image Acquisition: Raw images of skin conditions (Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Measles, Normal) will be collected. Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotations, flips, and zooms will be applied to create a balanced dataset with 1000 images per class. Data Storage: Pre-processed and augmented images will be stored in a structured format for easy retrieval. Algorithm Development/Model development: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Multiple CNN architectures (DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0) will be implemented and trained on the augmented dataset. Model Optimization: Models will be enhanced using techniques like Squeeze Excitation (SE) layers to improve performance. Validation and Testing: Models will be evaluated using validation datasets to ensure accuracy and generalization. Architecture Novelty: A novel architecture will be proposed during the work of this project. Explainable AI (XAI) integration: Computer-Aided Design (CAD): CAD tools will be utilized to provide insights into model decisions and feature importance. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME): LIME will be applied to generate interpretable explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency. Creating a thorough deep learning system to categorize viral skin disorders is a complex task that demands proficiency in AI, machine learning, medical imaging, and user experience design. Through careful system architecture design, implementation of sophisticated CNN models, integration of Explainable AI techniques, and rigorous testing and optimization, the system will provide precise and comprehensible diagnostic support for healthcare professionals. This will involve gathering and enhancing data, training and choosing models, seamlessly integrating with user interfaces, and continuously monitoring performance, to create a dependable and expandable system for classifying skin diseases.
