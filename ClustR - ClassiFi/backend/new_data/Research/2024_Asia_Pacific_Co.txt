B. Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset was evaluated for feature extraction using pre-
trained CNN models such as VGG19 and machine learning
algorithms, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting,
for discriminating between various subtypes of neurological
diseases. Fine-tuning was performed and features were used for
classification within fully connected layers. The evaluation of
the model was measured through evaluation metrics and
Ensembling methods were used to combine predictions for
improvement in accuracy [7]. An additional average

were quite high; they composed 94.48% of depression

addition, the result of both random forest and gradient boosting

combination of transfer learning, ensembled models, and

to attain an 82.51% accuracy. This suggests that pre-trained

neurological diseases.
