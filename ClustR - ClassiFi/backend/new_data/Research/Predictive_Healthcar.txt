This research paper provides a clearer understanding of
Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors, and depression,
their causes, symptoms, treatments, and impacts on society [6].
The current paper reports the method that has been used to
analyze literature and gather empirical data to provide insight
regarding these neurological diseases.
